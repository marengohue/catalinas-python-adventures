# Building a character sheet

## An Example
```python
import charactersheet

new_character = charactersheet.roll_new("Henrik", "M")
print(charactersheet.desribe(new_character))

"""
Henrik the Mighty is a human warrior. He is Noble, outgoing and bold. He comes from a rural family living on the Coast of Swords and he is gravely afraid of spiders. He is stronger then average, pretty agile and is slow to tire. He is not very bright and makes poor life choises. He is very charismatic.
In his right hand he is holding a large menacing bronze dagger. His pockets are filled with gold coins.
